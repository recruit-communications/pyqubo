PyQUBO
======

PyQUBO allows you to create QUBOs or Ising models from flexible mathematical expressions easily.
Some of the features of PyQUBO are

* **Python based (C++ backend).**
* **Fully integrated with Ocean SDK.** (`details <https://github.com/recruit-communications/pyqubo#integration-with-d-wave-ocean>`__)
* **Automatic validation of constraints.** (`details <https://pyqubo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#validation-of-constraints>`__)
* **Placeholder** for parameter tuning. (`details <https://pyqubo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#placeholder>`__)


For more details, see `PyQUBO Documentation <https://pyqubo.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Example Usage
-------------

Creating QUBO
`````````````

This example constructs a simple expression and compile it to ``model``.
By calling ``model.to_qubo()``, we get the resulting QUBO.
(This example solves `Number Partitioning Problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem>`_ with a set S = {4, 2, 7, 1})

>>> from pyqubo import Spin
>>> s1, s2, s3, s4 = Spin("s1"), Spin("s2"), Spin("s3"), Spin("s4")
>>> H = (4*s1 + 2*s2 + 7*s3 + s4)**2
>>> model = H.compile()
>>> qubo, offset = model.to_qubo()
>>> pprint(qubo) # doctest: +SKIP
{('s1', 's1'): -160.0,
('s1', 's2'): 64.0,
('s1', 's3'): 224.0,
('s1', 's4'): 32.0,
('s2', 's2'): -96.0,
('s2', 's3'): 112.0,
('s2', 's4'): 16.0,
('s3', 's3'): -196.0,
('s3', 's4'): 56.0,
('s4', 's4'): -52.0}

.. _integration:

Integration with D-Wave Ocean
`````````````````````````````

PyQUBO can output the `BinaryQuadraticModel(BQM) <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_dimod/reference/bqm.html>`_
which is compatible with `Sampler` class defined in D-Wave Ocean SDK.
In the example below, we solve the problem with `SimulatedAnnealingSampler`.

>>> import neal
>>> sampler = neal.SimulatedAnnealingSampler()
>>> bqm = model.to_bqm()
>>> sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=10)
>>> decoded_samples = model.decode_sampleset(sampleset)
>>> best_sample = min(decoded_samples, key=lambda x: x.energy)
>>> best_sample.sample # doctest: +SKIP
{'s1': 0, 's2': 0, 's3': 1, 's4': 0}

If you want to solve the problem by actual D-Wave machines,
just replace the `sampler` by a `DWaveCliqueSampler` instance, for example.


For more examples, see `example notebooks <https://github.com/recruit-communications/pyqubo/tree/master/notebooks>`_.


Benchmarking
------------

Since the core logic of the new PyQUBO (>=1.0.0) is written in C++ and the logic itself is also optimized, the execution time to produce QUBO has become shorter.
We benchmarked the execution time to produce QUBOs of TSP with the new PyQUBO (1.0.0) and the previous PyQUBO (0.4.0).
The result shows the new PyQUBO runs 1000 times faster as the problem size increases.

   :width: 550
   :height: 440
   :align: center

Execution time includes building Hamiltonian, compilation, and producing QUBOs. The code to produce the above result is found in `here <https://github.com/recruit-communications/pyqubo/tree/master/benchmark/>`_.
